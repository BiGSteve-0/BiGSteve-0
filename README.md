### Hello! My name is Steven - aka Big-O 🦒

## I'm a Data Engineer, data enthusiast, runner, and musician

- I'm currently working on scripting dynamic column mapping, data profiling, and error event handlers with SSIS.
- I'm currently advancing my skills in Powershell, SQL, and PowerBI, and also learning Python, R to finish the BI stack. 
- I'm looking to work on an android application or a large data research project.
- 2022 Goals: Get 2 more certifications,😊 run my first marathon, and also answer more questions from the community. 
- Fun Fact: I sing in a barbershop quartet and [Chorus] and have a pretty great classical music [playlist].
